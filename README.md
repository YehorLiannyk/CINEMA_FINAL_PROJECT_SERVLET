# Cinema Web Application with Java Servlet
## The EPAM Course Final task (Java Servlete API) 
### Introduction
This project is a web application implementation of a cinema WebApp using Java Servlet API.
In a nutshell, there are movies and their sessions, which you can search for using filters, then select needed one, choose seats and buy tickets. But first, you should sign up/in. After purchase, you can find your tickets on the user ticket page and download them in PDF format. Admin can add/remove new movies and movie sessions as well.

##### The system includes:
+ Schedule current films for a week from 9:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. (beginning of the last film).
+ An unauthorized user can see the session schedule, and available seats for current movies, and has the opportunity to sign up. The user should be able to sort the movie sessions' schedule by 
    1) the movie name;
    2) the number of available seats; 
    3) the date/time of the session (by default); as well as filter available movies (due to empty seats) in the schedule.
+ A signed-up user has to be able to purchase a ticket for the selected movie session.
+ The administrator can add a new movie to the schedule, cancel the movie, and review the attendance of the hall.
